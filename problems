A while ago, within 2 months or so, I was using Music Player and you and it is just amazing, currently it has updated to version 2.0 (Preview 13) and it just doesn't open anymore. I tried to reinstall it by downloading straight from the site and not even the old version works now. it appears in the task manager but soon closes
